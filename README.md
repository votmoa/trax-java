# trax-java 
This Java file creates the RFO Roof Control interface on the CCD computer, and communicates with the program on the roof control Arduino.  This program receives status updates and other messages from the Arduino and displays them both in status lights as well as the actual string in a JTextArea.  Command buttons send user input commands to the Arduino.
